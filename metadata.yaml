description: Though he lived much of his life in England, author Harold Bindloss never
  forgot the Canadian prairies where he spent some time as a farmer in his early adulthood.
  Weakened by disease later in life, Bindloss took up writing, and the vast majority
  of his westerns were set in the rolling plains of Canada. Winston of the Prairie
  is one of Bindloss' most acclaimed novels, and it's sure to please fans of classic
  westerns.
